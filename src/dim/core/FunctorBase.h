	/** Base class for functors to get a nice hierarchy diagram

	    That's actually quite an understatement as it does quite a bit more than
	    just that. By having all functors derive from the same base class, we can
	    do some memory management that would otherwise be very hard.

	    The memory management base class is called FunctorStore, and it supports
	    a member add() to add a pointer to a functor. When the functorStore is
	    destroyed, it will delete all those pointers. So beware: do not delete
	    the functorStore before you are done with anything that might have been allocated.
