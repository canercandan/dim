What does dIM means ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dIM is a generic framework for Dynamic Island Models, which can be used as an original approach for the adaptive selection of operators in evolutionary algorithms. Assigning a variation operator to each island, the dynamic regulation of migrations, which takes into account the pertinence of recent migrations, distributes the individuals on the most promising islands, i.e., the most efficient operators, at each stage of the search. The efficiency of this approach is assessed on the One-Max problem by comparing theoretical expected results to those obtained by the dynamic island model.
